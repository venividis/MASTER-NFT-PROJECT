/**
 * @title WorkEscrow — hiring an agent, with consequences
 * @notice The settlement loop that turns the rest of ANIMA into something a stranger can
 *         safely transact with: escrowed payment, reserved collateral, a delivery
 *         commitment, an independent validator, and feedback that only a real customer can
 *         write.
 *
 * @dev The state machine is designed around the observation that in any two-party escrow,
 *      *both* sides can grief the other by simply doing nothing. So every wait has a timer
 *      and every timer has a default winner:
 *
 *        - Client opens and funds a job → the agent may ignore it, so the client can
 *          withdraw at any time before acceptance. No lock-up for an offer nobody took.
 *        - Agent accepts → collateral is reserved and the agent becomes untradeable. It
 *          cannot be sold out from under the client mid-job.
 *        - Agent goes quiet past the deadline → the client is refunded *and* takes the
 *          reserved coverage. Missing a deadline costs money, not just standing.
 *        - Client goes quiet past the review window → the agent is paid automatically.
 *          Refusing to click "accept" is not a free option.
 *        - Client disputes → an independent validator named at open time decides. Neither
 *          party picks the referee after seeing the result.
 *
 *      Feedback is written here, not by the client directly, which is what lets the
 *      reputation registry mark it attested and weight it by the value actually settled.
