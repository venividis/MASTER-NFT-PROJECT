/**
 * @title ERC6492
 * @notice Signature validation for accounts that have not been deployed yet.
 *
 * @dev ANIMA needs this more than most protocols do, because counterfactual accounts are not an
 *      edge case here — they are the design. An ERC-6551 account has a deterministic address
 *      from the moment its token exists and is typically deployed lazily, on first use. So an
 *      agent can be listed, hired, or messaged at an address that holds no code, and every
 *      ERC-1271 check against it fails: a `staticcall` to an address with no code succeeds and
 *      returns nothing, which reads as "invalid signature" rather than "not deployed yet".
 *
 *      ERC-6492 (Final) fixes this by letting a signature carry its own deployment instructions,
 *      wrapped as `abi.encode(factory, factoryCalldata, innerSignature)` followed by a 32-byte
 *      magic suffix. The suffix value was chosen so it cannot collide with a valid ECDSA
 *      signature — its last byte, `0x92`, is not a legal `v`.
 *
 *      Validation is therefore state-changing: it may deploy the account. That is acceptable at
 *      a settlement site, which is where this is used, and is why it is not a `view` function.
 *      A caller that only wants to read should require the account to exist first.
