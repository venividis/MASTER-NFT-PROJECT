/**
 * @title AgentToken — a launch token with a floor under it
 * @notice The fungible token of a single ANIMA agent. Holders share in what the agent earns,
 *         and can always redeem their pro-rata slice of the treasury by burning.
 *
 * @dev The redemption mechanism is lifted from ERC-7641 (Intrinsic RevShare), and it is the
 *      reason to launch an agent here rather than on a bonding-curve casino.
 *
 *      A pump.fun-style token is backed by nothing: its price is whatever the last buyer
 *      paid, and when attention moves on it goes to zero. This token's price cannot go below
 *      `treasury / totalSupply`, because at any lower price anyone can buy tokens, burn
 *      them, and take out more than they put in. The floor is not a promise or a buyback
 *      programme someone has to remember to run — it is an arbitrage that enforces itself.
 *
 *      The treasury fills from the agent's actual revenue: escrow settlements, metered
 *      per-call fees, and a share of trading fees on its own launch curve. So the floor
 *      rises exactly insofar as the agent is genuinely useful, which is the incentive you
 *      want and the one these markets almost never have.
 *
 *      Burning is pro-rata over `totalSupply`, so redeeming never dilutes the remaining
 *      holders: the floor per token is invariant across a redemption, and strictly
 *      increasing in revenue.
