/**
 * @title AnimaBindings — letting the canonical registry point back at a real NFT
 * @notice ERC-8217 binding contract. Attaches an entry in the chain's singleton ERC-8004
 *         Identity Registry to a master NFT — an ANIMA agent, or any ERC-721/1155 — so that
 *         whoever owns the NFT controls the agent, and control follows sales automatically.
 *
 * @dev ANIMA implements ERC-8004's Identity Registry directly on its own token, which is the
 *      right design for a collection that wants its agents to *be* the NFTs. But the
 *      ecosystem is converging on one singleton registry per chain, and an agent that is not
 *      in it is invisible to indexers and clients that only look there.
 *
 *      This contract is the bridge. Register in the singleton, bind that registration here,
 *      and the agent is discoverable through the canonical path while its ownership,
 *      economics and accountability continue to live on the ANIMA token. Nothing about the
 *      ANIMA contract changes, and no duplicate source of truth is created: the 8004 record
 *      stores only this contract's address under the reserved `agent-binding` key, and this
 *      contract is the single place the token triple can be read.
 *
 *      **Bindings are immutable**, as ERC-8217 requires. A mutable binding would let an
 *      agent accumulate reputation under one NFT and then re-point at another, which is
 *      identity laundering with extra steps.
 *
 *      The binder must own the master token at bind time. ERC-8217 does not require this;
 *      without it anyone could bind their own agent id to someone else's blue-chip NFT and
 *      borrow its standing.
