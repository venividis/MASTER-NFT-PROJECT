 * The diamond exists to remove EIP-170's ceiling without acquiring an admin who can rewrite
 * an agent's rules after you have bought it. Two claims follow from that, and this file tests
 * both:
 *
 *   1. It is the same token. The other fourteen test files are the real proof — every one of
 *      them runs unmodified against this build under `npm run test:diamond`. What is added
 *      here is the direct comparison: the same script of operations applied to both builds
 *      must produce the same ERC-5646 fingerprint, which is a single hash over the whole of
 *      an agent's mutable state.
 *   2. It cannot be changed. No `diamondCut` selector is routed, no facet exposes one, and
 *      the initialiser is unreachable after construction.
