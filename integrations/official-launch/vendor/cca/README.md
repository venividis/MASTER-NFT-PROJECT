This repository contains the smart contracts for Continuous Clearing Auctions (CCAs). It is intended to be used in combination with the [Uniswap Liquidity Launcher](https://github.com/Uniswap/liquidity-launcher) contracts suite.

## Overview

CCA is a novel auction mechanism that generalizes the uniform-price auction into continuous time. It provides fair price discovery for bootstrapping initial liquidity while eliminating timing games and encouraging early participation (see [whitepaper](./docs/assets/whitepaper.pdf)).

The contracts can be used as a standalone auction or a part of a larger token distribution system. All contracts are MIT licensed.

## Installation

```bash
forge install
forge build
forge test
```

## Deployments

CCA instances are deployed via the [ContinuousClearingAuctionFactory](./src/ContinuousClearingAuctionFactory.sol). Each factory is bound to a single immutable [IProtocolFeeController](./lib/liquidity-launcher/src/interfaces/IProtocolFeeController.sol) which all auctions it creates use to compute and route protocol fees. Deploy a new factory to use a different fee controller.

Addresses are cannonical across select EVM chains. If it is not already deployed, it can be deployed by anyone following the [Deployment Guide](./docs/DeploymentGuide.md).

> \*v2.0.0 is the latest version of CCA and is the recommended version for production use. For more details, see the [Changelog](./CHANGELOG.md).

### CCALens

[CCALens](./src/lens/CCALens.sol) is a stateless periphery contract for offchain reads of auction state and initialized tick data. It is deployed separately from the factory and is safe to share across all auctions on a chain.
