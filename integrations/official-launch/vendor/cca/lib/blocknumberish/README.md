# BlockNumberish

A simple utility contract to get the current block number on different chains. Includes support for fetching Flashblock numbers on Unichain

## Gas breakdown

| Operation                               | Gas Used |
| --------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `block.number`                          | 7        |
| `getBlockNumberish` (other chains)      | 66       |
| `getBlockNumberish` (arbitrum-based)    | 5152     |
| `getFlashblockNumberish` (other chains) | 60       |
| `getFlashblockNumberish` (unichain)     | 5165     |
| bytecode size                           | 103      |

`getBlockNumberish` probes the `ArbSys(0x64)` precompile once in the constructor (checking that it has code and returns a valid block number) and caches the result in an immutable, so it routes through `ArbSys.arbBlockNumber()` on all Arbitrum and Orbit chains (Arbitrum One, Arbitrum Sepolia, Robinhood, etc.) without a hardcoded chain ID list, and uses `block.number` everywhere else.

## Installation

Add BlockNumberish to your foundry repo:

```bash
forge install https://github.com/Uniswap/blocknumberish
